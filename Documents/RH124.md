## Important Links and Study Points
Since there will be no Internet access, most of this will have to be done using command line arguments and `man` lookup.

- `man` and updating `man-db`.
- Shell will be Bash.
- It is important to check configuration/user changes and perform a reboot after every major step in the exam.

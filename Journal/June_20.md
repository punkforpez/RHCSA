# Spending Time With Systemd

Today was a bit of a challenging day at work so I wanted to come home and immediately crack into some RHCSA studying.

I have been spending a lot of time working on my method of study and have really come to embrace the Pomodoro technique.  It's just really nice to be able to kind of control things in small chunks while I'm studying - it helps to keep a more cohesive flow for me and prevents me from getting distracted as easily.

Today I spent a healthy amount of time playing around with systemd runlevels and so I wanted to document my findings into the [Runlevels.md](/Documents/Runlevels.md) file for later viewing. I still have more to add to this file over time but for now I feel it's a solid foundation.

I also spent a little sideproject time working on updating my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/punkforpez/dotfiles) files although I'm still waiting a while to finalize it and push to master.

### Systemd: The Monster in The Closet
Systemd has always been a bit of a sour subject with me, although I don't hate it as much as a lot of people.  I would prefer that it didn't exist but very much in a "If you can't beat them..." attitude I have learned to (begrudgingly) embrace it.

Studying some of the different runlevels and the way in which they are set has made me already start hating it less.  I'm interested to see what my standpoint is on the whole thing when I am finished with this course!

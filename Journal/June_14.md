# Piecing it all together.

### Studying for the RHCSA
I have finally committed to this, after who knows how many years of thinking about it.  I am completely inspired by my friend's rapid growth with Linux and his overaching passion and pursuit of learning all he can.  It reminded me frequently of my own journey with Linux and how much I love evolving with the many distros of Linux I've used over the years.

### This is going to be great
Having someone to study with really makes all of the difference for me.  It's going to be great being able to track and follow the steps we are both taking and to be able to contrast notes with each other.

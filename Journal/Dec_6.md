# Back to it!
It's been a long couple months off, but I had a lot of stuff to focus on.

I'm back at it again, on a Hackintosh of all things this time, and am ready to dive back into the studying process.

# Setting up a Code Environment on the Mac
This time around I decided to go all in with Visual Studio Code and the Github Desktop client -- because, when in Rome and all that. It's a different approach to what I am used to but it's kind of nice to do things in a GUI environment for a little change.

For the next few journal entries I'm forcing myself to only use VS Code and Github Desktop for syncing. I'm so used to doing things in Vim and the Terminal that I had to enable a vim extension in VS Code, because it's awesome, and couldn't really do it well without it. I just think in vim.

# Chapters Ahoy
I'm hoping to get up to Chapter 4 of the Jang Book by the end of the year but that might be a stretch with all of the Christmasy stuff going on.

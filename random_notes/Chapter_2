Network outline for test network needed per Ch. 2

	Domain 1	example.com
	Clients		server1
			tester1
	IP		192.168.122.0/24

	Domain 2	example.org
	Client		outsider1
	IP		192.168.100.0/24

	** For a total 3 VMs.  Server1 should be configured with minimal install w/GUI **

KVM-based VMs:
	-Normally configured in /etc/libvirt and /var/lib/libvirt

virt-install
	-terminal command to install VM without the GUI
	-key switches for the command
		-n(--name)	Sets the name of the VM
		--vcpus		Configures number of virtual CPUs
		-r(--ram)	Configures amount of RAM in MB
		--disk		Defines the virtual disk
		-l(--location)	Specifies directory or URL of install files
		--graphics	Graphical display (vnc, spice, and none)
		-x(--extra-args=)	Includes extra data, such as URL of a Kickstart file

virsh
	-command line installer
	-when run alone it will start it's own prompt
	-type 'help' to show options
	-useful virsh commands:
		autostart <domain>	configures domain to start with host boot
		capabilities		list capabilities of local hypervisor
		edit <domain>		edits XML configuration for domain
		list --all		lists all domains
		start <domain>		boots given domain
		shutdown <domain>	shuts down given domain
		destroy <domain>	immediate shutdown of a domain

virt-clone
	-used to clone an existing VM
	-make sure system being cloned is shutdown
	-if on a production network, it is best to boot to clone machine's rescue target
		*this is to enable modification of hostname and ip address
	-when cloning a machine with multiple disks, each one must be specified with the --file switch
